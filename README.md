# Generative AI in Geotechnical Engineering

## üéØ Purpose
This repository demonstrates how to leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI-powered coding assistants to process, analyze, and visualize large geotechnical datasets. It serves as a teaching tool for geotechnical engineers and data scientists to learn practical applications of generative AI in their field.

## üìä Dataset
The repository includes an example GeoJSON file from Geosetta containing **85,994 geotechnical data points** across the United States. This real-world dataset provides an excellent foundation for demonstrating various AI-assisted data processing tasks.

## üöÄ Example Tasks for AI Assistants

### Basic Data Analysis
1. **Count Total Points**
   - Ask: "Count the total number of points in the GeoJSON file"
   - Expected: 85,994 points

2. **Regional Distribution Analysis**
   - Ask: "Count points in Eastern US (longitude > -95) vs Western US"
   - Result: Eastern US: 69,055 points | Western US: 16,939 points

### Data Visualization
3. **Interactive Plotly Map**
   - Ask: "Create an interactive Plotly scatter map showing all geotechnical points with zoom capabilities"
   - AI generates complete Python code for interactive visualization

4. **Density Heatmap**

   - AI creates visual workflows without traditional drawing tools

6. **Mermaid Flowcharts**
   - Ask: "Create a Mermaid diagram showing the decision tree for soil classification based on coordinates"
   - Example output:
   ```mermaid
   graph TD

     B -->|< -100| C[Western Region]
     B -->|-100 to -85| D[Central Region]
     B -->|> -85| E[Eastern Region]
     C --> F[Seismic Zone Analysis]
     D --> G[Tornado Alley Considerations]
     E --> H[Hurricane Zone Analysis]
   ```

7. **Automated Report Generation**
   - Ask: "Generate a markdown report summarizing the geographical distribution, create statistical plots, and identify data clusters"
   - AI produces comprehensive analysis with embedded visualizations

8. **SQL Query Generation**
   - Ask: "Convert this GeoJSON to SQL CREATE and INSERT statements for a PostGIS database"
   - AI generates database-ready SQL with spatial data types

9. **Python Class Generation**
   - Ask: "Create a Python class to manage geotechnical boring logs with methods for filtering by region, depth, and soil type"
   - AI generates object-oriented code structure

10. **Data Quality Analysis**
    - Ask: "Identify potential data quality issues like duplicate points, outliers, or impossible coordinates"
    - AI performs automated QA/QC checks

### Multi-Agent Workflows

11. **Complex Analysis Pipeline**
    - Ask: "Use multiple agents to: 1) Clean the data, 2) Perform clustering analysis, 3) Generate visualizations, 4) Create a summary report"
    - Demonstrates agent orchestration for complex tasks

12. **Cross-Reference with External Data**
    - Ask: "Correlate these points with USGS earthquake data and identify high-risk zones"
    - Shows integration of multiple data sources

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- AI coding assistant (OpenCode, OpenAI API, Claude, GitHub Copilot, or similar)
- Basic familiarity with JSON/GeoJSON format

### Installing OpenCode (Recommended AI Assistant)

OpenCode is a powerful AI coding assistant that works directly in your terminal. Here's how to set it up:

1. **Install OpenCode**
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash
   ```

2. **Restart your terminal or reload your shell configuration**
   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc
   # or for zsh users:
   # source ~/.zshrc
   ```

3. **Set up your OpenRouter API key**
   ```bash
   opencode auth login
   ```
   Follow the prompts to enter your OpenRouter API key. You can get one at [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/).

4. **Start using OpenCode with this repository**
   ```bash
   # Navigate to the repository
   cd Generative_AI_In_Geotechnical
   
   # Start OpenCode
   opencode
   
   # Try an example prompt:
   # "Count the total number of points in Example_data_from_Geosetta.geojson"
   ```

### Using OpenCode's Plan Mode as a Learning Partner

OpenCode offers a unique **Plan Mode** feature that makes it an excellent learning companion for understanding geotechnical data processing:

#### What is Plan Mode?
Plan Mode (`opencode --plan`) allows you to explore and understand solutions before executing them. The AI will:
- Explain what it would do step-by-step
- Show you the code it would write
- Discuss different approaches
- Help you understand the logic without making actual changes

#### How to Use Plan Mode for Learning

1. **Start OpenCode in Plan Mode**
   ```bash
   opencode --plan
   ```

2. **Ask exploratory questions**
   ```
   # Example prompts in plan mode:
   "Show me how you would analyze the clustering patterns in this GeoJSON data"
   "Explain different ways to visualize this geotechnical data"
   "Walk me through creating a data pipeline for soil classification"
   ```

3. **Understand before executing**
   - Review the AI's planned approach
   - Ask follow-up questions about specific steps
   - Learn the reasoning behind each decision
   - Once comfortable, run without `--plan` to execute

#### Learning Partner Strategies

**For Beginners:**
- Start in plan mode to understand each step
- Ask "why" questions about the approach
- Request alternative solutions to compare methods

**For Intermediate Users:**
- Use plan mode to explore advanced techniques
- Compare different libraries and frameworks
- Understand performance implications

**For Advanced Users:**
- Explore architectural decisions
- Discuss optimization strategies
- Plan complex multi-step workflows

#### Example Learning Session
```bash
# Start in plan mode
opencode --plan

# Ask a learning-focused question
"I want to understand how to process this GeoJSON file. Can you walk me through:
1. How to parse the structure
2. What libraries would be best for analysis
3. Common pitfalls to avoid
Show me the code you would write and explain each part."

# Review the plan, ask clarifying questions
"Why did you choose pandas over geopandas for this task?"

# When ready, exit and run without --plan to execute
opencode
"Now implement the solution we discussed"
```

#### Benefits of Plan Mode for Learning
- **Risk-free exploration** - Understand without breaking anything
- **Deeper understanding** - See the reasoning behind solutions
- **Multiple perspectives** - Explore different approaches
- **Interactive learning** - Ask questions and get explanations
- **Build confidence** - Review before executing
