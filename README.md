# Generative AI in Geotechnical Engineering

## üéØ Purpose
This repository demonstrates how to leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI-powered coding assistants to process, analyze, and visualize large geotechnical datasets. It serves as a teaching tool for geotechnical engineers and data scientists to learn practical applications of generative AI in their field.

## üìä Dataset
The repository includes an example GeoJSON file from Geosetta containing **85,994 geotechnical data points** across the United States. This real-world dataset provides an excellent foundation for demonstrating various AI-assisted data processing tasks.

## üöÄ Example Tasks for AI Assistants

### Basic Data Analysis
1. **Count Total Points**
   - Ask: "Count the total number of points in the GeoJSON file"
   - Expected: 85,994 points

2. **Regional Distribution Analysis**
   - Ask: "Count points in Eastern US (longitude > -95) vs Western US"
   - Result: Eastern US: 69,055 points | Western US: 16,939 points

### Data Visualization
3. **Interactive Plotly Map**
   - Ask: "Create an interactive Plotly scatter map showing all geotechnical points with zoom capabilities"
   - AI generates complete Python code for interactive visualization

4. **Density Heatmap**
   - Ask: "Generate a heatmap showing the density of geotechnical investigations by state"
   - AI creates choropleth maps with state boundaries

### Advanced AI Applications

5. **SVG Network Diagram Generation**
   - Ask: "Generate an SVG diagram showing the data processing pipeline for geotechnical site investigation data"
   - AI creates visual workflows without traditional drawing tools

6. **Mermaid Flowcharts**
   - Ask: "Create a Mermaid diagram showing the decision tree for soil classification based on coordinates"
   - Example output:
   ```mermaid
   graph TD
     A[Load GeoJSON Data] --> B{Check Longitude}
     B -->|< -100| C[Western Region]
     B -->|-100 to -85| D[Central Region]
     B -->|> -85| E[Eastern Region]
     C --> F[Seismic Zone Analysis]
     D --> G[Tornado Alley Considerations]
     E --> H[Hurricane Zone Analysis]
   ```

7. **Automated Report Generation**
   - Ask: "Generate a markdown report summarizing the geographical distribution, create statistical plots, and identify data clusters"
   - AI produces comprehensive analysis with embedded visualizations

8. **SQL Query Generation**
   - Ask: "Convert this GeoJSON to SQL CREATE and INSERT statements for a PostGIS database"
   - AI generates database-ready SQL with spatial data types

9. **Python Class Generation**
   - Ask: "Create a Python class to manage geotechnical boring logs with methods for filtering by region, depth, and soil type"
   - AI generates object-oriented code structure

10. **Data Quality Analysis**
    - Ask: "Identify potential data quality issues like duplicate points, outliers, or impossible coordinates"
    - AI performs automated QA/QC checks

### Multi-Agent Workflows

11. **Complex Analysis Pipeline**
    - Ask: "Use multiple agents to: 1) Clean the data, 2) Perform clustering analysis, 3) Generate visualizations, 4) Create a summary report"
    - Demonstrates agent orchestration for complex tasks

12. **Cross-Reference with External Data**
    - Ask: "Correlate these points with USGS earthquake data and identify high-risk zones"
    - Shows integration of multiple data sources

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash
   ```

2. **Restart your terminal or reload your shell configuration**
   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc
   # or for zsh users:
   # source ~/.zshrc
   ```

3. **Set up your OpenRouter API key**
   ```bash
   opencode auth login
   ```
   Follow the prompts to enter your OpenRouter API key. You can get one at [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/).

4. **Start using OpenCode with this repository**
   ```bash
   # Navigate to the repository
   cd Generative_AI_In_Geotechnical
   
   # Start OpenCode
   opencode
   
   # Try an example prompt:
   # "Count the total number of points in Example_data_from_Geosetta.geojson"
   ```

### Quick Start
1. Clone this repository
2. Install OpenCode (see above) or use your preferred AI assistant
3. Load the example GeoJSON file
4. Try the example prompts with your AI assistant
5. Experiment with your own queries

### Example Python Setup
```python
import json
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px

# Load the geotechnical data
with open('Example_data_from_Geosetta.geojson', 'r') as f:
    data = json.load(f)

# Extract coordinates
points = []
for feature in data['features']:
    lon, lat = feature['geometry']['coordinates']
    points.append({'longitude': lon, 'latitude': lat})

df = pd.DataFrame(points)
print(f"Loaded {len(df)} geotechnical data points")
```
